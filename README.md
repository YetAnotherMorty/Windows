# Windows
An archive of various versions of Windows. Below you will find the versions of Windows that I've collected over the years. However, be informed that you are using these at your own risk. The sources weren't always the best to obtain the best, but they will suffice.

***Note:*** You must download all of the parts for each of the versions of Windows in order for you to extract them completely. I also use [DownGit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home) to make download links to make your life a little bit easier.
